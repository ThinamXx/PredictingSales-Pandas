# **Sales Data using Pandas**

Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.

**Note**
- It is a refreshment of **Pandas Library** for Understanding the Ground truth of the Data. I have tried to sketch the clear picture to deal with Sales Dataset using **Pandas**.

**Getting the Dataset**
- I have downloaded the Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-final-project/data).

**Objectives and Targets**
* I have tried to meet the target of this Notebook as mentioned above by answering the following questions:
  * What will be maximum Total Revenue among all shops in September, 2014 ?
  * Which Item generated the Highest Revenue in summer, 2014?
  * How many Items remain, or Price remains constant during whole period of time?
  * What was the variance of the Number of Items sold per day per sequence for the particular shop on December, 2014?
  
**Insights & Result**
- I have plotted a Daily Revenue or Sales of a particular shop in the month of December to draw the insights.
